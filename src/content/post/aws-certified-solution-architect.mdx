## Overview

I've worked with AWS daily since late 2006, jumping first into the world of EC2 managing LAMP servers for multi-tenent CMS deployments. I've kicked the tires on each new service as it was launched, incorporating some into my go-to architecture toolbox. But, the bredth of knowledge necessary to move beyond our daily experiences to the possibilities beyond requires additional investment. This is a meaningful certification, and has led to a much deeper ownership of many topics. These are the 5 that I find most valueable.

Intimate Knowledge of AWS Global Infrastructure: I've delved deep into AWS's intricate global infrastructure, including its data centers, availability zones, and edge locations. With this knowledge, I can recommend the most strategic AWS regions and services tailored to specific business objectives.

Expertise in Designing High-Availability Architectures: Ensuring application availability is paramount. Thanks to this certification, I've honed my expertise in tools like Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and multi-AZ deployments to ensure robust and resilient systems.

Mastery of Data Storage Solutions: Be it Amazon EBS, S3, RDS, or DynamoDB, I can pinpoint which storage solution will best serve an application's unique needs, optimizing both performance and cost.

Security First Approach: In an era where cyber threats are ever-evolving, I've equipped myself with the best practices in AWS security, encompassing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), security groups, and state-of-the-art encryption techniques.

Cost Optimization Strategies: I pride myself on my ability to provide cost-effective AWS solutions. Iâ€™m adept at recommending budget-friendly solutions, highlighting savings opportunities, and pinpointing the most advantageous pricing models.
